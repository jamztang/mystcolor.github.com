[Simplicity isn't simple](http://www.getfinch.com/2012/04/simplicity-isnt-simple/)

> Remove: Get rid of anything that isn’t essential to the application. This could mean content, too; like the language you use in the navigation labels.
>
> Organize: Arrange the elements of the interface so that they fit into logical chunks. This might mean based on a person’s mental model (how they think), or tie in to a more familiar interface pattern.
>
> Hide: Place the most important elements within reach (make them obvious), and hide the others, making them accessible through navigation.
>
> Displace: Pushing some of the functionality to another device, or feature, so that the one interface isn’t responsible for displaying every possible interaction.

When everything appeared organized and straight-forward, the effort behind are easily not being noticed.
