Ever needed a placeholder color for your lazy loaded table view cell image
view? Typically can create a 1x1 pixel image in PhotoShop, add it to your
project, then load it with UIImageNamed. Can't imagine how lots of effort and
steps, and if the placeholder color are requested to be updated, you'd have to
repeat the process all over again.

If you needed work with this kind of situations a lot, lets do it
programmatically and DRY! Consider the following UIImage+JTColor category.

    
<script src="https://gist.github.com/1571875.js?file=UIImage%2BJTColor.h"> </script>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/1571875.js?file=UIImage%2BJTColor.m"> </script>
  

Usage:

    
    #import "UIImage+JTColor.h"
    
    UIColor *color = [UIColor lightGrayColor];   // Or your whatever UIColor
    imageView.image = [UIImage imageWithColor:color];
    

  
Nothing magical but will saves you a lot of time.
